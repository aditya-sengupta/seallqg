Real-time control on SEAL, the Santa Cruz Extreme AO Lab computer. This is a new project built off the history of the tip-tilt control repository [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4321008). This code base will include:

- control code to be run on SEAL
- a script to make tip-tilt aberrations (atmospheric + vibration modes)
- control system simulations
- analysis of experimental data

Collection of utilities, experimental code, and results for adaptive optics control loop simulation.
