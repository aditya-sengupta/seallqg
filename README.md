# set-tt-control

SEAL Experiments to Tune Tip-Tilt Control. This is a new project built off the history of the tip-tilt control repository [here](github.com/aditya-sengupta/tip-tilt-control). This code base will include:

- control code to be run on SEAL, the Santa Cruz Extreme AO Lab computer
- a script to make tip-tilt aberrations (atmospheric + vibration modes)
- control system simulations
- analysis of experimental data

Collection of utilities, experimental code, and results for adaptive optics control loop simulation.
