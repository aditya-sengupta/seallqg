# sysid-tip-tilt

System identification for tip-tilt adaptive optics. This is a new project built off the history of the tip-tilt control repository [here](github.com/aditya-sengupta/tip-tilt-control). This code base will include:

- a script to make tip-tilt aberrations (atmospheric + vibration modes)
- control system simulations
- analysis of experimental data

Collection of utilities, experimental code, and results for adaptive optics control loop simulation.
